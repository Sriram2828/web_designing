    <div class="para">
        <p>It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: Rohit missed three
            of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain. Injuries,
            in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10 Test matches.
           He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before this stretch of
           games, a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1 series lead in
           England, months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia.</p>
